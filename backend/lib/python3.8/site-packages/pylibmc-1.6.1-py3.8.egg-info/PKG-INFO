        New in version 1.6.0
        ====================
        
        Though no major feature overhauls have taken place, this release is partially
        incompatible with 1.5.0. This stems from the fact that python-memcached is now
        using a flag that pylibmc has been using for some years. python-memcached uses
        it for a different purpose, and an incompatible one. We deemed that it would be
        better to support this interoperability. The change also means that Unicode
        strings are now stored as UTF-8 rather than pickled, which may or may not
        result in a slight performance improvement for this type of data.
        
        We have also introduced a `pickle_protocol` behavior to enable seamless
        interoperability between Python 2.x and 3.x. Also, this release introduces a
        ManyLinux wheel, making installation a breeze on ManyLinux systems (which I
        suppose is many linuxes.)
        
        New in version 1.5.0
        ====================
        
        This release fixes critical memory leaks in common code paths introduced in
        1.4.2. Also fixes a critical bug in a corner of the zlib inflation code, where
        prior memory errors would trigger a double free. Thank you to everybody
        involved in the making of this release, and especially `Eau de Web`__, without
        their contributions, this release and the bug fixes it contains wouldn't have
        been so expedient.

        .. comment: 1.5.x should have been an extension to 1.4.x, therefore it's best
           to keep the 1.4.x release announcement below.
        
        New in version 1.4.0
        ====================
        
        Brace yourself, Python 3.x support has come!
        
        Thanks to everybody involved in this project; this release involves less
        authors but **a lot** more work per person. Thanks especially to Harvey Falcic
        for the work he put in, without which there wouldn't be any Python 3.x support.
        Also thanks to Sergey Pashinin for the initial stab at the problem.
        
        Other than that, we had miscellaneous bug fixes, testing improvements, and
        documentation updates.
        
        Last but not least I would like to ask for your support in this project, either
        by helping out with development, testing, documentation or anything at all; or
        simply by donating some `magic internet money`__ to the project's Bitcoin
        address `12dveKhqiJWCY8zXT4kaHdHELXPeGAUo9h`__.
